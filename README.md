**Topic:** Naturalization of Images Through Emojis
**Research Question:** How do Emojis Naturalize Certain Images as Representations of Certain Ideas and Cultures?
**Literature Review**
In _Affective Practice of Soldiering: How Sharing Images Is Used to Spread Extremist and Racist Ethos on Soldiers of Odin Facebook Site_, Kaarina Nikunen discusses how emoji sharing among other forms of images can lead to the propagation of internalized racism.
This is significant in the political climate of anti-immigration sentiment especially across white countries which are also the ones which hold technological dominance and the companies creating these emojis to begin with.
In _The Nature, Function, and Value of Emojis as Contemporary Tools of Digital Interpersonal Communication_ emphasizes the role of emojis as practically its own language in interpersonal communication and therefore the importance of its implications.
**Exploring the Topic**
I intend to explore the topic through the analysis of emojis which are considered fully or not qualified and the subgroup they belong to. Variations of emojis across platforms will be taken into account. 
**Data Needed:** The research will require quantitative data of the most used emojis across platforms and qualitative data in terms of their context of usage and locally ascribed meanings.
An example would be ascribing sexual implications to emojis like peach and aubergine. Meta data describing the emojis and words associated with them will be needed to study associations.
**Tools and Methods:** The method of textual analysis will be used to identify the use of emojis in their context. Case studies can be done on specific emojis which have various connotations.
A thematic analysis can be done by grouping related emojis under larger categories to identify the biases of representating a single idea or culture. For example, babies and home related emojis for women. 
Python can be used to select emojis from text through identification of their unicode codepoint through distant reading.
