**Topic:** Naturalization of Images Through Emojis

**Abstract:** How do Emojis Naturalize Certain Images as Representations of Certain Ideas and Cultures? This project will explore the role played by emojis in the consolidation of certain kinds of representation of cultures and ideas. Emojis are already debated as being a language in itself and like any other mode of communication are subject to rules of discourse creation and propagation. Being a visual medium they will be studied as images depicting certain ideas and people in certain ways and their role in normalizing stereotypes. This is studied in the light of the larger power structure under which these emojis are created and spread.

**Research Question:** How do Emojis Naturalize Certain Images as Representations of Certain Ideas and Cultures?

**Description:** Emojis are a form of visual culture widely used today, arising from and most dominantly used in social media. Emojis are often not used in the exact context of their creation and have different interpretations like any other image. And like any other image, it is important to understand the influences and biases involved in the creation of the image and the larger picture of what it gets used for. For instance, the usage of a Noh mask emoji to depict mock anger or seriousness can lead to a mocking of the art form itself. This is not to claim that emojis should not be interpeted contextually and invidiually, but that knowing the exact source and history of the images that make the emoji can lead to more self awareness in their usage and the biases thus created.  

**Literature Review**
In _Affective Practice of Soldiering: How Sharing Images Is Used to Spread Extremist and Racist Ethos on Soldiers of Odin Facebook Site_, Kaarina Nikunen discusses how emoji sharing among other forms of images can lead to the propagation of internalized racism.
This is significant in the political climate of anti-immigration sentiment especially across white countries which are also the ones which hold technological dominance and the companies creating these emojis to begin with.
In _The Nature, Function, and Value of Emojis as Contemporary Tools of Digital Interpersonal Communication_ emphasizes the role of emojis as practically its own language in interpersonal communication and therefore the importance of its implications.

**Exploring the Topic**
I intend to explore the topic through the analysis of emojis which are considered fully or not qualified and the subgroup they belong to. Variations of emojis across platforms will be taken into account. 

**Data Needed:** The research will require quantitative data of the most used emojis across platforms and qualitative data in terms of their context of usage and locally ascribed meanings.
An example would be ascribing sexual implications to emojis like peach and aubergine. Meta data describing the emojis and words associated with them will be needed to study associations.

**Tools and Methods:** The method of textual analysis will be used to identify the use of emojis in their context. Case studies can be done on specific emojis which have various connotations.
A thematic analysis can be done by grouping related emojis under larger categories to identify the biases of representating a single idea or culture. For example, babies and home related emojis for women. 
Python can be used to select emojis from text through identification of their unicode codepoint through distant reading.
